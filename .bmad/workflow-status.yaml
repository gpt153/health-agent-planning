      - User research on nutrition tracking friction
    notes: |
      Pre-BMAD phase. Requirements gathered manually.
      Identified key problem: nutrition apps require tedious manual entry.
      Solution: Computer vision + AI conversation for effortless tracking.

    notes: |
      Pre-BMAD phase. Manual planning with phase-based approach.
      Phase 1: Core bot + memory + vision
      Phase 2: Multi-agent nutrition verification
      Phase 3: Sleep tracking (integrated into Phase 1)
      Phase 4: Gamification system
      Phase 5: Social/community features (not started)

      - REST API specification
    notes: |
      Pre-BMAD phase. Architecture decisions made and implemented.
      Key patterns: Agent-centric design, multi-agent coordination,
      graceful fallbacks, dependency injection.
      ADRs need to be retroactively documented.

  BMAD PLANNING WORKSPACE INITIALIZED: 2026-01-15

  This planning workspace was created retroactively for an existing production system.
  Health Agent has been deployed and running with 4/5 phases complete (10,000+ LOC).

  CURRENT STATE:
  - ✅ Production bot deployed on Telegram
  - ✅ Phases 1-4 complete (core bot, multi-agent nutrition, gamification)
  - ⚠️ Production database missing 10 recent migrations
  - ⏳ Phase 5 (social features) not started
  - 📝 BMAD documentation (epics, ADRs, PRDs) to be created

  IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
  1. Sync production database (10 migrations)
  2. Create retroactive ADRs for key decisions
  3. Plan Phase 5 using BMAD methodology
  4. Refactor agent module for maintainability

  BMAD ADOPTION GOALS:
  - Use epic-based instruction pattern for future SCAR tasks
  - Document decisions with ADRs (capture WHY, not just WHAT)
  - Apply scale-adaptive planning (Levels 0-4) for new features
  - Maintain context efficiency through subagent patterns

# Decision Log (To Be Populated with ADRs)
decisions:
  - date: 2025-11-15
    title: "PydanticAI for Conversational AI"
    adr: "adr/001-pydantic-ai-agent-framework.md"  # To be created
    impact: high
    rationale: "Type-safe agents with 50+ tools, better than LangChain for structured outputs"

  - date: 2025-11-20
    title: "Multi-Agent Nutrition Verification"
    adr: "adr/002-multi-agent-nutrition-debate.md"  # To be created
    impact: high
    rationale: "Reduces calorie variance 57-65% through Vision + USDA + Validation consensus"

  - date: 2025-11-12
    title: "Memory Layering Architecture"
    adr: "adr/003-memory-layering-strategy.md"  # To be created
    impact: medium
    rationale: "PostgreSQL (structured) + Markdown (user-readable) + Mem0 (semantic)"

  - date: 2025-12-10
    title: "Gamification Integration Strategy"
    adr: "adr/004-gamification-system-design.md"  # To be created
    impact: medium
    rationale: "XP/streaks/achievements combat tracking fatigue, reward consistency"

# Review Schedule

  review_notes: |
    2026-01-15: BMAD planning workspace initialized.
    Codebase researched (10,000+ LOC, 26 tables, 38 tests).
    Project brief and workflow status populated.
    Next: Create retroactive ADRs and plan Phase 5.
